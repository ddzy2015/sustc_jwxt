# sustc_jwxt
<br>
This is a project that provide access to jwxt in Sustech to select courses.<br>
It's a so unstable and unreliable project that even the developer dare not to use it choose courses.<br>
The project is developed under JDK1.8, using eclipse and apparently it is still under developing.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the following project:<br>
