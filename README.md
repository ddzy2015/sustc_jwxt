# sustc_jwxt

This is a project that provide access to jwxt in Sustech to select courses.
It's a so unstable and unreliable project that even the developer dare not to use it choose courses.
The project is developed under JDK1.8, using eclipse and apparently it is still under developing.

Thanks for the following project:
